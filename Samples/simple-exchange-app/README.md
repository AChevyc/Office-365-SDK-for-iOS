## Quick Instructions

1. Clone the ADALiOS repo at the same position in your file system as this repo.
2. Open sdk-objectivec/office365_odata_base/office365_odata_base.xcodeproj and build for simulator. <br />
   (NB: If you want to build for device, you'll need to point this sample app at the built frameworks for a device.)
3. Open sdk-objectivec/office365_exchange_sdk/office365_exchange_sdk.xcodeproj and build for simulator. <br />
   (NB: Same note as above: if building for device, fix references in sample app).
4. Build or run Samples/simple-exchange-sample/simple-exchange-sample.app.
